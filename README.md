# Calculator

First project of the Java mentorship by Thiago Oliveira.

## About the project

The project aims to put into practice concepts related to the Object-Oriented Programming (POO) paradigm. The idea is to develop a calculator that provides basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation), body mass index (BMI) calculation, and area calculation for basic geometric shapes (circle, square, and rectangle). The project will be developed following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
